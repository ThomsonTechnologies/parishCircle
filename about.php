    <h4>What is Parish Circle ?</h4>
  <p>â€œFor where two for three gather in my name, there I am among them" -- Mathew 18:20<br><br>
Parish Circle is a social media network created specifically for Catholics.
It is a church without walls for your parish and an online gathering place
for communication within the Catholic community.
Stay informed about what is going on in your parish through creating pages for
everyone to see or communicate with other parishioners individually.<br><br>

 <h4>How it works?</h4>
<p>Parish circle is similar to facebook. But why then parish circle ?
The answer is simple. Its about your parish. Its about your family.
Even families in small parishes are unknown to each other. That is why the parish circle is important.
It allows you to create profile if your parish account exists.
This page is usually created by your parish head or representative.
And again the parish priest can create an account for parish only if his diocese page exists.
So its starting from top to bottom. The parish/diocese representative who
create accounts respectively manages the frofiles therein. That way it is self validating.
If a non parishoner/parish is created under false family/parish profiles
the representative who handles their parish/diocese account can inform/remove them.</p>
